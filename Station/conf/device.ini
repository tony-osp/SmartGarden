; This is default hardware definition file for SmartGarden Master station.
; This file can be used to define hardware config and topology, 
;   e.g. to define the number of connected channels, Remote stations etc.
;
; This file should be placed in root directory with predefined name of "device.ini". 
; When doing factory reset, hardware configuration will be imported into EEPROM.

; The file format - standard old-school Windows ini file.
; Please make sure that any line (including comment lines) is no longer than 128 characters.

; Stations map. 
;
; When running on Arduino Mega SmartGarden firmware supports up to 16 Stations,
; which includes local (directly connected to the Master controller) and Remote stations.
; Station ID is represented by a number (from 0 to 15).
; In the UI it is represented by a single Hexadecimal digit, with StationID of zero being the Master controller.
;
; Each station can have up to 8 channels. Total number of channels across all stations
; should be no more than 64 for Arduino Mega-based hardware.
;
; By convention channels directly connected to the Master controller should be assigned to Station 0,
; and if the number of channels connected to Master is more than 8 - remaining channels should be assigned
; to Station 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. This leaves station numbers of 1 to 9 for Remote stations.
;
; However this assignment is by-convention, and it is possible to configure other mappings.
